# Epi Build APP
* This app will let the user run his unit tests directly via an application, or even run his company norminette on his project before released it to their customers or managers.
* We have an option to see with a circle progress bar how many percent of unit tests you passed or how many percent you respect your standard norm.
* You can also run your custom rules and see what happened.
* For all Epitech Students you can also run the first rules to test if you repository is good to be push to the Epitech Servers.

# Info
The app can't work without a vps server with the Epi Build Server running.
